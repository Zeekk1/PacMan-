Key_File:mlLearningAgents

This project implements a Pac-Man to behave optimally using Q-learning. 
The goal is to train the agent to to maximize cumulative rewards through reinforcement learning techniques.
The implementation highlights key AI principles such as policy learning, reward-based adaptation, and autonomous decision-making.
